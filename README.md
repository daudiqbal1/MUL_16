This is the code for a 16 bit multiplexer that runs on 8051 microcontroller. 
Special thing about this code is its ability to use the 8 bit registers to  multiply the 16 bit inputs and return a 32 bit output.
The inputs and outputs are unsigned integer 

Removing Stack for this branch, values of registers are changed by the subroutine..
